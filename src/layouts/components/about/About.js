        <h1>FAQ</h1>
      <b><i>You can tell the future?</i></b><br/>
        <p>
          No, that is obviously charlatanism.
        </p><br/>

        <b><i>So what's the point?</i></b><br/>
        <p>
          The value I see in Tarot readings is similar to the <a><b>Oblique Strategies</b></a> project.
          Subconscious associations are very valid forms of inspiration and the tarot if a magnific symbollic language full of eternal human tropes.
          Plus, interpretations are really fun to make and receive.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <b><i>How much?</i></b><br/>
        <p>
          You can get a spread of cards for free. (Minus gas fees, of course). I can also upload video interpretations of the spread but I don't <b>guarantee</b> it.
          You can pass along an ETH incentive with your petition to make it more juicy for me but it's not necessary. Additionally if you feel unsatisfied with my resposne time you can get the incentive back after 1 week.
        </p><br/>

        <b><i>IPFS? SWARM?</i></b><br/>
        <p>
          Like I mentioned in the answer above. I can upload video intepretations of your generated spread, IPFS and SWARM are decentralized file hosting options.
          This guarantees that the government won't take down your video interpretations, hooray! (It's inconvinient in other ways, but the option is there)
        </p><br/>


        <b><i>Are the Readings Cryptocollectibles></i></b><br/>
        <p>
          Cool thought, but no, there are no trading capabilities.
        </p><br/>

        <b><i>When moon?</i></b><br/>
        <p>
          The Moon is the #18 Major Arcana, especially significant to crypto hodlers! However, moon never, there's no token / ICO / speculation of any kind associated with this site.
        </p><br/>

        <b><i>How do I make a petition? What's ETH? I don't understand a lot of things! </i></b><br/>
        <p>
          Welcome! You look a little lost and there's a lot to cover, looking into <a href="https://metamask.io">this</a> is probably a good start.
